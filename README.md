# The Tunnel

#### A platformer game with an interesting story and gameplay
Done using UE5 Blueprints

### Current state:
Done: 
- Movement (walk, jump, attack, dash)
- First level for testing features
- Attack functionality
- First simple attacking AI (Skeleton)
- Killzone (Spikes tile)

Closest features:
- Start town
- Few levels

In plans:
- Combo
- Mobs
- Main town
- Story


Personal reasons to do this project:
- Learn UE API through using blueprints basics and then transferring loaded features into C++ code.
- Create a platformer with enjoyable features, smooth movement and interesting story
