# The Tunnel

#### A platformer game with an interesting story and gameplay
Done using UE5 Blueprints

### Current state:
Done: 
- Movement (walk, jump, attack, dash) + (Coyete Time, Jump Buffering)
- First level for testing features
- Attack functionality (currently only short version, long version in plans, Attack with sword WILL NOT BE MAIN means to deal with enemies)
- First simple attacking AI (Skeleton)
- Killzone (Spikes tile)

Closest features:
- Other means to deal with enemies (rolling through to send them into the air, sliding, pressing down etc.)
- Start town (Main menu townlike)
- Few levels (Tutorial levels first)

In plans:
- Mobs 
- Story (This one will be hard if not made simplified)


Personal reasons for making this project:
- Learn UE API through using blueprints basics and then transferring loaded features into C++ code.
- Create a platformer with enjoyable features, smooth movement and interesting story
